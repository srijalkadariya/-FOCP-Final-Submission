#  The Unixspellcommand is a simple spell-checker.It prints out all the words in a text file that are not found in a dictionary. Write and test an implementation of this, that takes a file name as a command-line argument. Note: You may want to simplify the program at first by testing with a text file that does not contain any punctuation. A complete version should obviously be able to handle normal files, with punctuation. Another Note: You will need a list of valid words. Linux users will already have one (probably in /usr/share/dict/words). It is more complicated,as usual, for Windows users. Happily, there are several available on GitHub.

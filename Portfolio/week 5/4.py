#Write a program that takes a URL as a command-line argument and reports whether or not there is a working website at that address. Hint: You need to get the HTTP response code. Another Hint: StackOverflow is your friend.

url = "https://www.srijalkadariya.com.np"  # Replace with the URL you want to test

try:
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)  # Make an HTTP GET request
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"The website at {url} is working (HTTP {response.status_code}).")
    else:
        print(f"The website at {url} is reachable but returned HTTP {response.status_code}.")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:

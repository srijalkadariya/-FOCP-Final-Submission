This is the final assessment submission for the module (FOCP). 

This repo includes three folders ie. "Portfolio", "Project-chat" and "Project-f1".

The "Portfolio" floder includes all the weekly tasks that we were assigned to do on each week of our class.

The "Project-chat" folder includes a new system for answering questions from prospective students, based on an interactive online chat.

The "Project-f1" folder includes a program that analyses a file generated by the timing system that displays the performance of the current drivers.
